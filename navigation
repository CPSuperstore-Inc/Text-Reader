To run the game, double-click 'Text Reader.py' in the root directory.
all of the python code is in the 'code' folder.
NOTE: '__init__.py' is blank, and should always be blank

configurations/settings are in the 'configurations' folder. The data structure of this 
closley resembles JSON, but is actualy a python dictonary spaced over many lines
in both configuration files, blank lines are ignored, and any line CONTAINING a 
double forward slash (//) is ignored as well.

the text files for the program to read are in the 'files' folder.

If you want the program as an executable file (.exe) please go to my website's page for this game.
