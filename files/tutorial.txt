Welcome To "Text Reader"! A Simple Text File Reading Program. Press "SPACE" To Continue.
As You Can See, "SPACE" Advances Lines! This can be changed in the "key_bindings.txt" file in the "configurations" Folder.
In "config.txt", which is located in the same folder as "key_bindings.txt", you can change some other properties.
Some of these properties include the background color, Font Properties, text alignment, and which order to read files in!
In fact, in this file, there are 12 properties which can be changed!
If you need to quit the program, simply press "Escape". This can also be changed in "key_bindings.txt".
If you run into any problems, E-Mail me immediately at cpsuperstoreinc@gmail.com. Set the E-Mail a high priority/important email, no matter the concern.
Enjoy This Program, and have fun.
